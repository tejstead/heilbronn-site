"""Exact one-parameter families of optimal configurations.

Five proven entries are non-unique, and for each the family (or a
one-parameter slice of it) has an exact closed form derived on this site:

  square n=3    apex slides along the top edge: p2 = (x, 1), x in [0, 1].
  square n=6    the shear x -> x + t(1-2y) applied to the point set,
                t in [0, 1/2]; a shear is area-preserving, so every
                triangle's area is invariant. t = 1/2 is the 90-degree
                rotation image of t = 0. (Dress-Yang-Zeng family.)
  triangle n=5  p1 slides along the bottom edge: (x, 0),
                x in [2-sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]  (right frame).
  triangle n=6  p2 slides along the left edge: (0, y), y in [1/4, 3/8].
  convex n=7    center + two equilateral orbits 30 degrees apart, radius
                ratio s in [sqrt(3)/2, 2/sqrt(3)]; samples rescaled so the
                hull area stays that of the stored member.

Every emitted sample is a 30-decimal truncation of an exact family member,
and generate() verifies each sample's exact-literal value against the
stored configuration's exact value at relative 1e-20 — the build fails if
any sample falls short.
