# Contributing a configuration

Found a better arrangement — or have the original coordinates for an entry
this site only shows as a reconstruction? Submissions are plain pull
requests, verified automatically in exact arithmetic.

Most PRs to this repository are prepared by automated search pipelines and
LLM agents, and that's expected — this document is written to be followed
mechanically. **There is one submission lane**: `data/sources/external/`,
for everyone, including this site's own search pipeline. (The
`data/sources/tejsteadqc/` directory is a legacy sync lane; do not add new
entries to it.)

## What to add

One directory per configuration — two required files, plus an optional
third if you know the exact algebraic value. A single PR may contain any
number of configuration directories; nothing else.

```
data/sources/external/<variant>-nNN/
├── coordinates.txt    required — the configuration
├── meta.json          required — provenance, credit, page note
└── exact.json         optional — the value's minimal polynomial
```

`<variant>` is `square`, `triangle`, or `convex`; `NN` is the zero-padded
point count (e.g. `triangle-n15`, `square-n07`). The number of points in
`coordinates.txt` must equal `NN`.

### coordinates.txt

One point per line, two decimal literals separated by whitespace. Lines
starting with `#` are comments.

```
# any comment you like
0.041156363310095543088824043693	0.917687273379808913822351912614
0.041156363310095543088824043693	0.041156363310095543088824043693
```

- **Plain decimals only** — no exponents, no fractions, at most 6 integer
  digits and 200 decimal places per literal. Literals are parsed as exact
  rationals, so what you write is exactly what is verified.
- **Frames.** `square`: 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 1. `triangle`: the unit right triangle
  x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, x + y ≤ 1 (values are reported normalized to a unit-area
  triangle, i.e. doubled). `convex`: any coordinates — the domain is the
  points' own convex hull, and the value is area-normalized.
- **Feasibility is checked exactly.** A point at `0.9999999999…` with 200
  digits is fine; a point at `1.0000000001` is not. When rounding interior
  results, truncate toward zero (for the triangle this keeps x + y ≤ 1
  exactly; for the square it keeps coordinates inside [0, 1]).
- **Precision: 15 decimals minimum, 30 recommended.** Two reasons. Sources
  are ranked by the exact value their literals achieve, so a 30-decimal
  literal of a converged optimum beats a shorter one of the same
  arrangement. And the page's tie structure is computed exactly within
  1e-9 of the minimum: below ~12 decimals the intended ties collapse and
  the figure shows fewer minimal triangles than your configuration really
  has (the verifier warns when this is about to happen).

### meta.json

```json
{
 "ref": "where these coordinates come from (paper, repo, pipeline run)",
 "credit": "Your Name, August 2026",
 "note": "anything the configuration page should say about them"
}
```

`ref` is required; `credit` and `note` are optional but encouraged.

- `credit` should be `"Human Name, Month YYYY"` — if your submission beats
  the published record, this string becomes the entry's **Found by** line,
  so use the person's name, not a bot or account name.
- `note` is shown verbatim on the configuration's page provenance — write
  it for readers (method, one sentence, no marketing).

### exact.json (optional — for exact values)

If you know the configuration's exact value, add its **minimal polynomial**
as an integer coefficient list, constant term first, for the normalized
value A the site reports:

```json
{
 "minimal_polynomial": [-4, -13, 5438, 161469, 1609650, 5250987]
}
```

(that example encodes 5250987A⁵ + 1609650A⁴ + 161469A³ + 5438A² − 13A − 4,
the triangle n = 15 value). Coefficients too large for 64-bit tools may be
written as strings. No expression syntax is accepted — coefficients only.

The checker confirms in exact arithmetic that the polynomial has a root
within 1e-9 (relative) of the value implied by your coordinates —
irreducibility/minimality is not machine-checked, so double-check it
yourself before submitting. If your submission wins the entry, the
polynomial is re-validated at build time and rendered on the page.

## What happens on the PR

A workflow re-verifies every changed submission with the site's exact
verifier — all C(n,3) triples in rational arithmetic — and comments on the
PR with the exact value, tie structure, detected symmetry, and how it
compares to the current canonical entry. Invalid submissions (infeasible,
malformed, wrong point count, exact-value mismatch) fail the check; read
the comment, fix, push again.

Contributors listed in `.github/trusted-submitters.txt` skip review: their
PRs merge automatically once verification and CI pass — but only when the
PR touches nothing but `data/sources/external/` directories. Everyone
else's submissions wait for the maintainer to click merge. Any change to
code, templates, workflows, or curated data always requires review.

A submission that verifies but scores **below** the current value is still
welcome when it has provenance value — for example an original author's
arrangement for an entry we only have as a reconstruction. Say so in the
`note`.

After merge, `build/ingest.py` picks the best source per entry by exact
value, regenerates `data/canonical/`, and the site rebuilds and deploys
automatically — your configuration is live within about ten minutes.

## Checklist for automated agents

1. One directory per configuration under `data/sources/external/`, named
   `<variant>-nNN`; touch no other paths.
2. `coordinates.txt`: exactly NN points, plain decimals, 30 decimal places,
   truncated toward zero; verify feasibility in exact arithmetic before
   opening the PR.
3. `meta.json`: `ref` (required), `credit` as `"Human Name, Month YYYY"`,
   `note` one informative sentence.
4. `exact.json` only if you have verified the polynomial yourself.
5. Run the same check CI will run:
   `python3 scripts/check_submission.py data/sources/external/<dir>`.
6. After opening the PR, read the verification comment; on failure, fix and
   push to the same branch.

## Notes, corrections, references

Not everything needs coordinates. Corrections to credits, history, or notes
are PRs against `data/curated/` (`overrides.json`, `changelog.json`,
`references.json`) — see the existing entries for the shape. These are
reviewed by hand rather than by the verifier.

## Local check

```
make check-submission DIRS=data/sources/external/<variant>-nNN
make test
